"Term:English","Description:English"
"Archie","A search tool for finding files and programs located on FTP servers. The Archie system is comprised of a number of Archie servers located across the United States and the world. Each Archie server indexes the files available on FTP servers in its area. The Archie servers share their indexes with each other; thus, the complete index is accessible from any of the servers. Archie servers can be accessed via a Telnet, e- mail or an Archie program."
"ARPAnet","The predecessor to the Internet. Developed by the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency in the late 1960s, ARPAnet was an experimental network that initially linked scientists engaged in defense research. ARPAnet was intended to link together different computers in dispersed geographical locations. The network was designed to survive breakdowns along any of its connections by sending information as packets. If a connection broke down, the packets could be automatically re-routed."
"ASCII","ASCII (pronounced AS-key): American Standard Code for Information Exchange. Although now widely used to denote plain text - that is, text without formatting and independent of any type font - ASCII is actually a data code now used universally in communication applications by minicomputers and personal computers to represent 128 possible character combinations, including upper- and lower-case letters of the roman alphabet, the space character, the numerals 0 through 9, punctuation marks and other non-alphanumeric characters found on a standard keyboard, plus several \"control codes\" that denote invisible characters like the carriage return and tab. ASCII is also sometimes known as TTY, denoting its legacy in the teletype industry."
"ASCII value","The number, variously expressed in decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation, that defines a combination of eight bits -- seven bits that define a character and an eighth that can be used for a rudimentary form of error correction known as \"parity checking.\""
"ASCII table","A table that lists the ASCII value for any character, in decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation, sometimes in all three."
"avatar","avatar (pronounced AV-uh-tar): A word adopted by computer users to denote the digital manifestation that humans take on when entering virtual worlds. The word is Sanskrit for the earthly incarnation a god takes on Earth. Vishnu, the Hindu god responsible for maintaining the existence of the universe, has 10 important avatars, including Krishna, the philosopher king, and Varaha, the boar who rescues the planet after it is inundated by the oceans. The 10th avatar of Vishnu, Kalki, will arrive in the future to destroy the world with fire and begin a new age of purity on the planet."
"AVI","A video compression standard developed for use with Microsoft Windows. Video clips on the World Wide Web are usually available in both AVI and QuickTime formats."
"bandwidth","The amount of information that can be transmitted over a network connection. Data travel over bandwidth in bits-per-second. A full page of English text is about 16,000 bits. A fast modem can move about 28,800 bits per second."
"baud","(pronounced BAWD) A unit commonly used to describe the speed of modems. The baud rate technically is the number of times a modem signal changes per second. In the old days of 300 baud modems, each signal change represented one bit of information. Therefore, the baud and transfer rates of a modem - measured in bits per second, or bps - were the same. Modern modems transfer up to 12 bits of information for every signal change. A 28.8 modem is actually is working at 2400 baud, but each signal change carries 12 bits of information. Therefore the data transfer rate is 28,800 bits per second. Over the years, baud and bits per second have been used interchangeably, although that is technically wrong."

"GIF","GIF, gif (pronounced GIFF -- as in \"gift\" -- or JIFF): Graphics Interchange Format. Developed by CompuServe, GIF is a widely-used method of compressing image files such as photographs and graphics. Image files typically take up large amounts of computer memory and hard drive space and take long periods of time to download. Various groups have come up with ways of alleviating some of these problems by compressing the image data into smaller files. JPEG is a competing image-compression format."
"Gopher","A menu-based system used in organizing and retrieving files and programs on the Internet.

"hexadecimal","hexadecimal (pronounced hex-uh-DES-I-mull): Numbers expressed in base sixteen. Integers larger than 9 are expressed as sequential letters A through F. In hexadecimal, the number ten is written A. The number sixteen is expressed as 10 - that is, one sixteen and no ones, just as 10 in the standard decimal system represents one ten and no ones. Why would anyone want to express numbers in base sixteen? Because that's how many bits there are in a 16-bit word, so using hexadecimal allowed programmers to denote a specific bit in any word as a single digit, 0 through F. Back in the days of eight-bit machines, programmers used octal, or base eight, numbers."
